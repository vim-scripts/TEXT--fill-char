Script for on-the-fly indenting of columns according
to the previous or next line (it allows for instance to easily align
'=' sign in a sequence of C initializations, and much more).

EXAMPLE:

previous cursor) 

EXAMPLE:

line1: Chapter1 ...................... 7
line2: Chapter2 .|

After use :FillUpPrevious is situation this:

line1: Chapter1 ...................... 7
